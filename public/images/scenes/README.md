# Scene Reference Images

This folder is for **travel scene reference images** used by the AI travel photo feature.  
Image files (`.jpg`, `.png`, etc.) are **not** committed to the repository to keep the repo size small.

## How to get the images

1. See **[docs/SCENE_IMAGES_SOURCES.md](../../../docs/SCENE_IMAGES_SOURCES.md)** for download links (Unsplash, Pexels, etc.) and the exact filename for each scene.
2. Download the images and place them here with the correct filenames (e.g. `taipei101.jpg`, `jiufen.jpg`).
3. Scene list and status: **[docs/SCENE_IMAGES_STATUS.md](../../../docs/SCENE_IMAGES_STATUS.md)**.

## Without these images

The app still works: it will use **text prompts only** for scene generation when a reference image is missing. Adding reference images improves output quality and consistency.
